           <h1 id="box"> Heres How You Can Start A Business:</h1>
           <article>
            Starting a small business can feel big at first, but if you break it down into steps, it becomes much easier.<br>Here’s a
            simple roadmap you can follow:<br>
            
            <strong>1. Come Up With an Idea</strong><br>
            
            Think about what you’re good at or what people around you need.<br>
            
            Examples: baking snacks, tutoring, selling crafts, offering computer help, or reselling clothes.<br>
            
           <strong> 2. Do Some Research</strong><br>
            
            Who will buy your product/service? (friends, neighbors, students, etc.)<br>
            
            Who else is selling it? Can you do it better, cheaper, or more uniquely?<br>
            
            <strong>3. Make a Small Plan</strong><br>
            
            Decide what you’ll sell, how much you’ll charge, and where you’ll sell (online, at school, local market, etc.).<br>
            
            Write down your costs (ingredients, materials, tools) and how much profit you’ll make.<br>
            
            <strong>4. Start Small</strong><br>
            
            You don’t need lots of money to begin—start with what you have.<br>
            
            For example, if you want to sell cookies, bake a small batch and test them with friends.<br>
            
            <strong>5. Spread the Word</strong><br>
            
            Tell friends and family.<br>
            
            Use free social media like WhatsApp, Instagram, or TikTok to show what you’re selling.<br>
            
            Word of mouth is powerful—treat your first customers well!<br>
            
            <strong>6. Manage Your Money</strong><br>
            
            Keep business money separate from personal money.<br>
            
            Always write down sales, costs, and profits.<br>
            
            <strong>7. Grow Slowly</strong><br>
            
            Once you see demand, reinvest some of your profit to make more products or improve your service.<br>
            
            Listen to customer feedback and adjust.<br>
